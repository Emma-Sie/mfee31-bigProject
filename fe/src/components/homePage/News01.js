          There was some real uncertainty this offseason
          about the future of Lee Sang-hyeok, better known
          as Faker. There were reports about offers he
          received from the LCS, and also rumors about him
          seriously considering moving to another region for
          the first time in his career. All those rumors
          turned out to be untrue though, as Faker will stay
          with T1 until 2025.
          <br />
          <br />
          This wasn't the first time we were anxious about
          the future of Faker and T1, as there are rumors
          surrounding The Unkillable Demon King almost every
          League of Legends offseason. Either it's a blank
          check from an NA team or a $20 million per year
          offer from an LPL team. Still, Faker has rejected
          all those crazy offers and stayed loyal to T1 and
          the LCK.

          T1 Reveal Contract Extension With LoL Star Faker
          The news just broke moments ago on social media:
          This time it weren't leakers or esports insiders
          that informed us about Faker's contract extension,
          but T1 themselves. To the joy of all T1 fans
          around the world, their team legend will stay for
          at least three more years
          <br />
          <br />
          This is a big announcement in every way. We have
          already talked about how Faker, now 26 years old,
          is one of the oldest players in the LCK. He and
          Deft, his rival from the League of Legends Worlds
          Finals, are real oldtimers in Korean League of
          Legends. By the end of the contract he just signed
          with T1, he will be 29. Still, we have no doubt
          that he will amaze us countless times over the
          course of the coming years and we're glad he's
          doing it with T1.
